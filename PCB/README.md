The Ingot TKL PCB is officially supported by QMK/VIA.

You can download the VIA flash file here or through [VIA's website](https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/download_firmware) under relapsekb_or87_via.hex.
If you prefer to use QMK, visit [Ingot QMK Repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/relapsekb/or87).

It is recommended to flash the PCB once receiving your Ingot as the firmware on it has been updated since. 
If you have never flashed a PCB before, please follow instructions found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuBJbdCFF0Q).

The supported layouts for the PCB can be seen below:
